According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration\\u2019s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. \\u201cThe Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD\\u2019s study and will continue to defend the president\\u2019s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,\\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: \\u201cAs mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.\\u201d Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal \\u201cgreat news.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it\\u2019s not good for the military or our country,\\u201d Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama\\u2019s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military \\u201ccannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\\u201d Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump\\u2019s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president\\u2019s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants\\u2019 sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept \\u201csome individuals who are not medically fit for service.\\u201d The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump\\u2019s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president\\u2019s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. \",\n          \"SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge \\u201cmuch more\\u201d to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     \\u201cWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!\\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president\\u2019s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the \\u201cAmazon Washington Post\\u201d fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump\\u2019s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. \\u201cWe do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,\\u201d he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers\\u2019 doorsteps. Amazon\\u2019s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump\\u2019s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its \\u201cproductive relationship\\u201d with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service\\u2019s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump\\u2019s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service\\u2019s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump\\u2019s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. \\u201cThis investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,\\u201d Graham said on CBS\\u2019s Face the Nation news program. \\u201cAnd we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he\\u2019s the right guy at the right time.\\u201d  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump\\u2019s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller\\u2019s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was \\u201cgoing to be fair.\\u201d    Russia\\u2019s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI\\u2019s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller\\u2019s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  \\u201cI want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,\\u201d Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. \\u201cAs a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,\\u201d he said. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"December 31, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration\\u2019s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. \\u201cThe Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD\\u2019s study and will continue to defend the president\\u2019s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,\\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: \\u201cAs mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.\\u201d Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal \\u201cgreat news.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it\\u2019s not good for the military or our country,\\u201d Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama\\u2019s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military \\u201ccannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\\u201d Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump\\u2019s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president\\u2019s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants\\u2019 sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept \\u201csome individuals who are not medically fit for service.\\u201d The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump\\u2019s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president\\u2019s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. \",\n          \"SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge \\u201cmuch more\\u201d to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     \\u201cWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!\\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president\\u2019s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the \\u201cAmazon Washington Post\\u201d fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump\\u2019s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. \\u201cWe do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,\\u201d he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers\\u2019 doorsteps. Amazon\\u2019s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump\\u2019s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its \\u201cproductive relationship\\u201d with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service\\u2019s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump\\u2019s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service\\u2019s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump\\u2019s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. \\u201cThis investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,\\u201d Graham said on CBS\\u2019s Face the Nation news program. \\u201cAnd we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he\\u2019s the right guy at the right time.\\u201d  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump\\u2019s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller\\u2019s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was \\u201cgoing to be fair.\\u201d    Russia\\u2019s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI\\u2019s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller\\u2019s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  \\u201cI want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,\\u201d Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. \\u201cAs a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,\\u201d he said. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"December 31, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Just after gutting health care for up to 24 million Americans, then throwing a kegger for Republicans who were complicit in an attack on their own constituents, Donald Trump decided to take a vacay and go golfing.This morning Trump tweeted from his social media podium,  Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money! Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2017So, after sticking a knife in the middle class and lower-income Americans by passing Trumpcare through the House, the former reality show star traipsed off to his fancy golf club which costs members $300,000 a shot. Again, that was after he gave the top 2 percent a trillion dollar tax cut while gifting the bottom 40 percent with having to pay for it with their health care. Are we tired of all this winning yet? Apparently, the 70-year-old alleged president is so he s taking a break.Trump is spending a long weekend at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, NJ.This is his 21st visit to a golf course as president. https://t.co/6Cijy24jLr  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 5, 2017While the amateur president claims he ll be  working  at his  home  which is not really his home since he s supposed to reside in the White House, his work day doesn t look very filled up, according to Politico.TRUMP S SCHEDULE: President Donald Trump is at his Bedminster Golf Club in New Jersey and has no public events scheduled.That s all that is listed on his schedule. The former reality show star thinks being leader of the free world is a 9-5 type of gig with an extra day off for knifing the poor and middle class.During the same period of time in Barack Obama s presidency, he golfed once. One time. And Donald Trump repeatedly disparaged him for it. As of April 2nd, Trump spent nine consecutive weekends at Trump-owned properties, bringing up once more his mounting conflicts of interest.Trump was already in New York City where he could have spent time with his wife, who is totally in love with him, and their son, Barron. But, according to Trump, he didn t want to  cause a disruption.  Now far be it from us to call him a Big Old Liar, but Trump didn t remain in NYC, because everyone there hates him. And that may or may not include his wife. Who knows.It s really bad optics to screw the poor over then go golfing with wealthy people. To Trump, saving us money means costing us more money. We re living in an alt-reality where facts don t matter anymore.Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images.\",\n          \"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran said on Friday it would retaliate against any action targeting its armed forces and accused the United States of violating the spirit of the 2015 nuclear deal reached between Tehran and six major powers. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected later on Friday to take a major step against the nuclear deal, laying out a more aggressive approach to Iranian activities in the Middle East that risks upsetting U.S. ties with European allies.  Iran will strongly respond to any action against its military forces, including the Revolutionary Guards Corps,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state TV. A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Friday that steps Trump is reviewing as part of a broader strategy also include imposing targeted sanctions in response to Iran s ballistic missile tests, cyber espionage and backing of Lebanese Hezbollah and other groups on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. The U.S. administration earlier this year considered, but then put on hold, adding the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran s most powerful internal and external security force, to the U.S. list. Qasemi said Iran will continue building up its ballistic missile capability in defiance of Western criticism, with Washington saying the Islamic Republic s stance violates the nuclear deal with the powers.  Iran s missile program is only for defensive purposes ... we are determined and serious about expanding it,  he said. Qasemi also warned about possibility of pulling out of the deal.  Iran always acts based on its interests and will continue to do so. If necessary, we can also withdraw from the deal,  Qasemi said.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Just after gutting health care for up to 24 million Americans, then throwing a kegger for Republicans who were complicit in an attack on their own constituents, Donald Trump decided to take a vacay and go golfing.This morning Trump tweeted from his social media podium,  Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money! Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2017So, after sticking a knife in the middle class and lower-income Americans by passing Trumpcare through the House, the former reality show star traipsed off to his fancy golf club which costs members $300,000 a shot. Again, that was after he gave the top 2 percent a trillion dollar tax cut while gifting the bottom 40 percent with having to pay for it with their health care. Are we tired of all this winning yet? Apparently, the 70-year-old alleged president is so he s taking a break.Trump is spending a long weekend at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, NJ.This is his 21st visit to a golf course as president. https://t.co/6Cijy24jLr  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 5, 2017While the amateur president claims he ll be  working  at his  home  which is not really his home since he s supposed to reside in the White House, his work day doesn t look very filled up, according to Politico.TRUMP S SCHEDULE: President Donald Trump is at his Bedminster Golf Club in New Jersey and has no public events scheduled.That s all that is listed on his schedule. The former reality show star thinks being leader of the free world is a 9-5 type of gig with an extra day off for knifing the poor and middle class.During the same period of time in Barack Obama s presidency, he golfed once. One time. And Donald Trump repeatedly disparaged him for it. As of April 2nd, Trump spent nine consecutive weekends at Trump-owned properties, bringing up once more his mounting conflicts of interest.Trump was already in New York City where he could have spent time with his wife, who is totally in love with him, and their son, Barron. But, according to Trump, he didn t want to  cause a disruption.  Now far be it from us to call him a Big Old Liar, but Trump didn t remain in NYC, because everyone there hates him. And that may or may not include his wife. Who knows.It s really bad optics to screw the poor over then go golfing with wealthy people. To Trump, saving us money means costing us more money.

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected later on Friday to take a major step against the nuclear deal, laying out a more aggressive approach to Iranian activities in the Middle East that risks upsetting U.S. ties with European allies.  Iran will strongly respond to any action against its military forces, including the Revolutionary Guards Corps,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state TV. A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Friday that steps Trump is reviewing as part of a broader strategy also include imposing targeted sanctions in response to Iran s ballistic missile tests, cyber espionage and backing of Lebanese Hezbollah and other groups on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. The U.S. administration earlier this year considered, but then put on hold, adding the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran s most powerful internal and external security force, to the U.S. list. Qasemi said Iran will continue building up its ballistic missile capability in defiance of Western criticism, with Washington saying the Islamic Republic s stance violates the nuclear deal with the powers.  Iran s missile program is only for defensive purposes ... we are determined and serious about expanding it,  he said. Qasemi also warned about possibility of pulling out of the deal.  Iran always acts based on its interests and will continue to do so. If necessary, we can also withdraw from the deal,  Qasemi said.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Aug 8, 2017\",\n          \"February 27, 2016\",\n          \"May 18, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Following the G7 summit, where Trump s childish arrogance was on full display, Schulz simply shredded Trump for his treatment of Merkel: Election campaign or no election campaign, in this situation let me be entirely clear: the chancellor represent all of us at summits like these. And I reject with outrage the way this man takes it upon himself to treat the head of our country s government. That is unacceptable. It is, but it s hard to expect Trump to understand that at this point. In his mind, he s the most important person ever to walk the planet. As such, he was, more or less, a complete asshole during his visit to Europe. He called Germany who, up until now, was our most powerful European ally bad, very bad,  for their trade policies. He said that German sells millions of cars in the U.S. and implied that we get nothing from it, so it is going to stop. He proved with those statements that he has no idea that German automakers actually employ thousands of U.S. workers inside U.S. borders.Trump had the gall to castigate NATO, too, for allegedly freeloading off the U.S. as though we make up for the money they aren t spending (in truth, that two percent mark that NATO allies are supposed to reach refers to the percentage of their individual GDPs they need to commit to their national defenses). He also yelled at them for the cost of their new headquarters, almost acting as though we paid for it without voting for it.For her part, Merkel has since said that Germany (and probably NATO) can t rely on us as a partner anymore. That s a dangerous position for us to be in   Trump is throwing away everything we ve worked towards with Europe because he s a dickbag.Elsewhere, he showed his total asshattery by shoving the prime minister of Montenegro aside to get to the front of a photo op. His body language there read,  Do you know who I am?  according to one body language expert who analyzed his postures during that and two other incidents at the summit.Those other two incidents involve French President Macron. The first is when Macron arrived in Italy   as he was walking towards the leaders who were already there, Trump stuck his hands out to greet him, but Macron veered toward Merkel to greet her first. He greeted two other leaders before making it to Trump, who then yanked him toward him as though to show him who was boss.Then there was the now-famous  white-knuckled handshake  with Macron, who admitted that wasn t totally innocent. He wanted to show Trump that France, and by extension, Europe, would not allow Trump to bully them.Some have interpreted Schulz s comments as an attack on Merkel he did appear to also say that she shouldn t have allowed Trump to treat her the way he did but the bottom line is this: When someone s chief political rival takes their side against someone else, that someone else has royally screwed up.Featured image by Olivier Douliery Pool via Getty Images\",\n          \"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke by phone regarding a Iraqi Kurdish independence referendum and voiced concern that it will cause regional chaos, Erdogan s office said on Sunday.  The two leaders noted that not cancelling the referendum will bring with it chaos in the region and they stressed the great importance which they attach to Iraq s territorial integrity,  the statement said. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mitch McConnell, the U.S. Senate\\u2019s top Republican, clung to slim hopes on Tuesday that his party could still dismantle Obamacare, despite not having adequate support for a repeal bill. Facing the possibility of another failure to make good on their 7-year-old pledge to roll back the healthcare law, McConnell told senators the debate on healthcare would continue. He said nothing about whether he would bring the repeal bill to a vote, leaving open the option of letting the measure simply die if more firm votes for it cannot be nailed down. Republicans have vowed for years to get rid of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, but they are up against a Sept. 30 deadline to pass a bill with a simple majority, or face a much tougher path toward dismantling it. Senator Susan Collins rebuffed intense lobbying from fellow Republicans and the promise of money for her state when she decided on Monday to oppose - and likely doom - the latest effort to repeal Obamacare. It was a blow for President Donald Trump who has made undoing Democratic former President Barack Obama\\u2019s signature healthcare law a top priority since the 2016 campaign and who pressured Collins in a call on Monday. Republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate and  at least two other Republican senators, John McCain and Rand Paul, have already rejected the bill. No votes from McCain, Collins and another Republican, Lisa Murkowski, killed an effort by the Senate to undo Obamacare in July. While Obamacare extended health insurance to some 20 million Americans, many Republicans believe it is an unwarranted and costly government intrusion into healthcare, while also opposing taxes it imposed on the wealthy. McConnell opened the Senate on Tuesday by praising the measure, which is sponsored by Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy. He said it contrasted sharply with Democratic proposals for \\u201csingle-payer\\u201d healthcare. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an important debate for our country,\\u201d McConnell said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s one that will certainly continue.\\u201d The Graham-Cassidy bill would take federal money spent on the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, as well as subsidies to help Americans buy private insurance, and divvy it up to the states in block grants. One main complaint by opponents of the bill is that it would mean sweeping cuts in funding to Medicaid. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Just after gutting health care for up to 24 million Americans, then throwing a kegger for Republicans who were complicit in an attack on their own constituents, Donald Trump decided to take a vacay and go golfing.This morning Trump tweeted from his social media podium,  Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money! Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2017So, after sticking a knife in the middle class and lower-income Americans by passing Trumpcare through the House, the former reality show star traipsed off to his fancy golf club which costs members $300,000 a shot. Again, that was after he gave the top 2 percent a trillion dollar tax cut while gifting the bottom 40 percent with having to pay for it with their health care. Are we tired of all this winning yet? Apparently, the 70-year-old alleged president is so he s taking a break.Trump is spending a long weekend at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, NJ.This is his 21st visit to a golf course as president. https://t.co/6Cijy24jLr  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 5, 2017While the amateur president claims he ll be  working  at his  home  which is not really his home since he s supposed to reside in the White House, his work day doesn t look very filled up, according to Politico.TRUMP S SCHEDULE: President Donald Trump is at his Bedminster Golf Club in New Jersey and has no public events scheduled.That s all that is listed on his schedule. The former reality show star thinks being leader of the free world is a 9-5 type of gig with an extra day off for knifing the poor and middle class.During the same period of time in Barack Obama s presidency, he golfed once. One time. And Donald Trump repeatedly disparaged him for it. As of April 2nd, Trump spent nine consecutive weekends at Trump-owned properties, bringing up once more his mounting conflicts of interest.Trump was already in New York City where he could have spent time with his wife, who is totally in love with him, and their son, Barron. But, according to Trump, he didn t want to  cause a disruption.  Now far be it from us to call him a Big Old Liar, but Trump didn t remain in NYC, because everyone there hates him. And that may or may not include his wife. Who knows.It s really bad optics to screw the poor over then go golfing with wealthy people. To Trump, saving us money means costing us more money.

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected later on Friday to take a major step against the nuclear deal, laying out a more aggressive approach to Iranian activities in the Middle East that risks upsetting U.S. ties with European allies.  Iran will strongly respond to any action against its military forces, including the Revolutionary Guards Corps,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state TV. A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Friday that steps Trump is reviewing as part of a broader strategy also include imposing targeted sanctions in response to Iran s ballistic missile tests, cyber espionage and backing of Lebanese Hezbollah and other groups on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. The U.S. administration earlier this year considered, but then put on hold, adding the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran s most powerful internal and external security force, to the U.S. list. Qasemi said Iran will continue building up its ballistic missile capability in defiance of Western criticism, with Washington saying the Islamic Republic s stance violates the nuclear deal with the powers.  Iran s missile program is only for defensive purposes ... we are determined and serious about expanding it,  he said. Qasemi also warned about possibility of pulling out of the deal.  Iran always acts based on its interests and will continue to do so. If necessary, we can also withdraw from the deal,  Qasemi said.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Just after gutting health care for up to 24 million Americans, then throwing a kegger for Republicans who were complicit in an attack on their own constituents, Donald Trump decided to take a vacay and go golfing.This morning Trump tweeted from his social media podium,  Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money! Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2017So, after sticking a knife in the middle class and lower-income Americans by passing Trumpcare through the House, the former reality show star traipsed off to his fancy golf club which costs members $300,000 a shot. Again, that was after he gave the top 2 percent a trillion dollar tax cut while gifting the bottom 40 percent with having to pay for it with their health care. Are we tired of all this winning yet? Apparently, the 70-year-old alleged president is so he s taking a break.Trump is spending a long weekend at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, NJ.This is his 21st visit to a golf course as president. https://t.co/6Cijy24jLr  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 5, 2017While the amateur president claims he ll be  working  at his  home  which is not really his home since he s supposed to reside in the White House, his work day doesn t look very filled up, according to Politico.TRUMP S SCHEDULE: President Donald Trump is at his Bedminster Golf Club in New Jersey and has no public events scheduled.That s all that is listed on his schedule. The former reality show star thinks being leader of the free world is a 9-5 type of gig with an extra day off for knifing the poor and middle class.During the same period of time in Barack Obama s presidency, he golfed once. One time. And Donald Trump repeatedly disparaged him for it. As of April 2nd, Trump spent nine consecutive weekends at Trump-owned properties, bringing up once more his mounting conflicts of interest.Trump was already in New York City where he could have spent time with his wife, who is totally in love with him, and their son, Barron. But, according to Trump, he didn t want to  cause a disruption.  Now far be it from us to call him a Big Old Liar, but Trump didn t remain in NYC, because everyone there hates him. And that may or may not include his wife. Who knows.It s really bad optics to screw the poor over then go golfing with wealthy people. To Trump, saving us money means costing us more money.

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected later on Friday to take a major step against the nuclear deal, laying out a more aggressive approach to Iranian activities in the Middle East that risks upsetting U.S. ties with European allies.  Iran will strongly respond to any action against its military forces, including the Revolutionary Guards Corps,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state TV. A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Friday that steps Trump is reviewing as part of a broader strategy also include imposing targeted sanctions in response to Iran s ballistic missile tests, cyber espionage and backing of Lebanese Hezbollah and other groups on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. The U.S. administration earlier this year considered, but then put on hold, adding the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran s most powerful internal and external security force, to the U.S. list. Qasemi said Iran will continue building up its ballistic missile capability in defiance of Western criticism, with Washington saying the Islamic Republic s stance violates the nuclear deal with the powers.  Iran s missile program is only for defensive purposes ... we are determined and serious about expanding it,  he said. Qasemi also warned about possibility of pulling out of the deal.  Iran always acts based on its interests and will continue to do so. If necessary, we can also withdraw from the deal,  Qasemi said.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
